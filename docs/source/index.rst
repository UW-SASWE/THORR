THORR
=====

THORR stands for **T**\ hermal **H**\ istory **o**\ f **R**\ egulated **R**\ ivers. It is a tool for generating  spatio-temporally continuous water temperature estimates for rivers and reservoirs. The water temperature estimates are generated by using a combination of satellite remote sensing data and data-driven techniques. The techniques used in THORR make it possible to reconstruct the hydro-thermal behavior of regulated river networks, including narrow rivers where either traditional remote sensing techniques are not applicable or in-situ data are scarce.

THORR is designed to be scalable, allowing users to apply it in any  river network. When used in a new river network, users can either adopt a pretrained machine learning model or train their own model where appropriate and feasible. Generating spatio-teporal water temperature in a river network requires an effecient data management system, therefore THORR's data is stored in a relational database (either PostgreSQL or MySQL). With all these capabilities of THORR, we hope THORR can be extended to a global scale to help researchers and water resource managers to better understand the hydro-thermal behavior of regulated river networks.

   OUTLINE:
   THORR â€“ Thermal History of Regulated Rivers
   + include disclaimers
   Installation
   Database setup
   Intro: Give an intro to the database system
   Can be done in both MySQL and PostgreSQL
   -	Preparation of GIS data (put things in the geopackage format with the basic layers)
   -	Upload the GIS data to the database
   Satellite data retrieval
   -	Retrieve data for only both the dams and the reaches
   Estimate water temperature
   -	Reach water temperature estimation. Current version 
   o	Using our pre-trained model
   o	To-do: Training your own model.
   -	The current version does not include estimates for reservoirs as the reaches extend over the reservoirs.
